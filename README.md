This repository provides scripts which setup my MacOS environment with basic software / tools.

**Note:** My `dotfiles` are not included in this repository.

### **Usage:**

To run the entire setup from scratch, run:

```bash
$ ./setup.sh
```

This will install a variety of `brew` packages / casks, install `Python` and set some system defaults.
